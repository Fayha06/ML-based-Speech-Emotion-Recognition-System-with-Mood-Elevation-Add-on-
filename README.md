# About the Project:
This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) system that classifies emotions from speech using key audio features like MFCC, Chroma, and Mel Spectrogram. It utilizes five ML algorithms—Random Forest, MLP, SVM, Decision Tree, and KNN—to recognize eight emotions: happy, sad, angry, surprise, calm, neutral, fearful, and disgust.
Mood Elevation Add-on is integrated to enhance user experience. Based on the predicted emotion, the system suggests generalized music, activities, or self-improvement content through pre-defined YouTube links.

The application is built with Streamlit, offering a simple user interface where users can upload a .wav audio file, receive an emotion prediction, and view mood-based suggestions.
